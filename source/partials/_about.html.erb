      <div class="info">
        <p>I'm originally from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, but moved to the Midwest to study at the University of Notre Dame. I will with graduate a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Design in the Winter of 2014 and from there, I do not know where I will end up. When I'm not pushing around pixels or building out one of my many ideas, you can most likely find me photographing, longboarding, drinking coffee, or bboying. Feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@iheanyi.com" class="fancy-link">get in touch</a> with me, especially if you have questions about anything!</p>
