        <p>Not only am I able to do front-end development, but I also have experience with backend development in PHP, Python (Flask, some Django, CherryPy), and I'm currently dabbling with Ruby on Rails.</p>

        <p>
          I'm familiar with the Android SDK and Android Development, having developed five Android applications â€“ two of my own and three that are proprietary or research-related. Within my applications, I do my best to follow Google's Design Guidelines to allow for a consistent user experience.

        <h3 class="card-header center">User Interface Design</h3>

        <p>Before designing any of my websites and applications, I design the user interfaces, starting with a general wireframe and depending on the project, making a full mockup using Sketch. This allows me to get a general feel for how the user will interact with the website or application.</p>
