             WhoBorrowed is an inventory management application for individuals to keep track of who is borrowing their stuff. I'm building this not only as a tool for myself but also as my main project for learning the Ruby on Rails framework, keep in mind the demo is still a work in progress, but feel free to fiddle around with it.
