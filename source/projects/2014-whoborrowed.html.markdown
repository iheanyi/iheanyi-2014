             WhoBorrowed is a my latest project that I've been working on to learn the Ruby on Rails web framework. It's going to be a simplistic application to keep track of your items and belongings, stay tuned for the release!

WhoBorrowed is an inventory management application for individuals to keep track of who is borrowing their stuff. I'm building this not only as a tool for myself but also as my main project for learning the Ruby on Rails framework, keep in mind the demo is still a work in progress, but feel free to fiddle around with it.
